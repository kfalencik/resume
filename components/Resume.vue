      <h3 class="h3">My story.</h3>
      <img src="~/assets/images/lightbulb.png" width="120" role="presentation" alt="" />
      <p>Shortly after I was born my parents decided to move back to Poland, where I spent most of my life. <span class="speed">Growing up</span> I remember always being very curious about computers and how they work. I have a very vivid memory of my <span class="speed">8-year-old-self</span> sitting in front of our very <span class="speed">first family computer</span>, trying to open some of the files in "Windows" directory and deleting them cause I thought it would speed-up the computer (these are unreadable garbage anyways!) until <span class="speed">it died</span>. That's when I experienced my first <span class="speed">blue-screen</span>, a lot of dad's shouting and a week ban for the computer but <span class="speed">my curiosity grew even larger</span>.</p>
      
      <img src="~/assets/images/arrow.png" width="100" role="presentation" alt="" />  
      <p>Not long after this incident, my parents had a great idea to send me to one of those <span class="speed">"Learn how to use the computer"</span> courses which consisted mainly of me playing the <span class="speed">pinball game on Windows XP</span> (oh the good old days) but also my first introduction to the internet and more importantly the golden god of web langauges - <span class="speed">HTML</span>. I was immedietally hooked. With a couple lines of code I can put together a very basic but real website!</p>
      <p>By the <span class="speed">age of 15</span> I have learned <span class="speed">PHP</span> and developed about 5 or 6 websites for the local businesses. Some of them still exist and remain unchanged (what???), like this one for <span class="speed">one of the biggest coffin manufacturers</span> in Europe - <a class="speed" href="http://www.zpdlindner.pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZPD Lindner</a>. I had tons of fun <strike>stealing everyones code</strike> programming and gathering more and more knowledge everyday. I knew <span class="speed">this is what I want to do</span> as an adult so I applied to <span class="speed">one of the best technical schools in Poland</span> that offered IT courses.</p>
      
      <img src="~/assets/images/book.png" width="120" role="presentation" alt="" />  
      <p>To be very honest, <span class="speed">I didn't learn much</span> there. Although it WAS a good school, IT knowledge I got from it was mostly general or <span class="speed">not relevant to web technologies</span>. Second half of the third year introduced a class called "Web applications" which I <span class="speed">totally smashed because of my previous knowledge and experience</span>.</p>
      <p>After four years it was time to chose my <span class="speed">University</span>. I moved to a bigger city and started my three-years long IT course with the hopes of getting <span class="speed">actual web-app knowledge</span>. In the mean-time I found my <span class="speed">first offical job</span> as a junior <span class="speed">Drupal</span> developer which was super exciting for me and really spread my wings as a developer. About 4 months into the course I learned that - <span class="speed">nope</span>, the course has nothing to do with web-apps and I decided to <span class="speed">drop-out</span> and continue gaining experience at my job.</p>

      <img src="~/assets/images/paperplane.png" width="120" role="presentation" alt="" />
      <p>The idea of moving countries came out of nowhere really. I had a good, steady job, I had my friends, I was happy but my <span class="speed">natural curiosity</span> was telling me to <span class="speed">go and discover</span>. I figured why not try something (or someplace) new? If anything goes wrong or I don't like it, <span class="speed">I can always come back</span>. I knew nothing about Scotland or <span class="speed">Edinburgh</span> before moving here but when I finally arrived, holding bags containing all of my life belongings, I saw the city for the first time, <span class="speed">fell in love</span> and decided to stay.</p>

        <p>My first job after moving to Edinburgh. Thanks to a small size of the agency I was involved in a great number of very <span class="speed">creative and innovative</span> projects.

      <h3 class="h3">Outro.</h3>

      <p><span class="speed">Thank you</span> for visting my page. I would like to shortly talk about the tools I used to create <span class="speed">this website</span>.</p>
      <p>In order to achieve this <strike>monstrosity</strike> beautiful looking site I have used <span class="speed">Nuxt.js</span> framework which I love using for pretty much all of my side projects. Nuxt.js is sort of a Vue.js on steroids. Contains pretty much everything you need to create a vue website including: routing, a store which you can use to easily send and receive data beteen components, development server and also server side rendering which is great for SEO!</p>
      <p>For styling I'm obviously using <span class="speed">SASS</span>, and <span class="speed">BEM</span> naming convention for my class names. In terms of back end, well this is all handled by <span class="speed">Netlify</span> and deployed using <span class="speed">Github</span> - no server required (yay).</p>
      <p>The very nice dynamic marble effect background uses some black svg <span class="speed">magic</span> and to be honest with you I have no idea how it actually works.</p>
      <p>Fun fact, no media queries were used when developing this site.</p>
      <p>That's all, <span class="speed">BYE!</span></p>
