      <h3 class="h3">My story.</h3>
      <img src="~assets/images/lightbulb.png" width="120" role="presentation" alt="" />
      <p>
        Shortly after I was born my parents decided to move back to Poland, where I spent most of my life.
        <span class="speed">Growing up</span> I remember always being very curious about computers and how they work. I
        have a very vivid memory of my <span class="speed">8-year-old-self</span> sitting in front of our very
        <span class="speed">first family computer</span>, trying to open some of the files in "Windows" directory and
        deleting them cause I thought it would speed-up the computer (these are unreadable garbage anyways!) until
        <span class="speed">it died</span>. That's when I experienced my first <span class="speed">blue-screen</span>, a
        lot of dad's shouting and a week ban for the computer but
        <span class="speed">my curiosity grew even larger</span>.
      </p>

      <img src="~assets/images/arrow.png" width="100" role="presentation" alt="" />
      <p>
        Not long after this incident, my parents had a great idea to send me to one of those
        <span class="speed">"Learn how to use the computer"</span> courses which consisted mainly of me playing the
        <span class="speed">pinball game on Windows XP</span> (oh the good old days) but also my first introduction to
        the internet and more importantly the golden god of web languages - <span class="speed">HTML</span>. I was
        immediately hooked. With a couple of lines of code, I can put together a very basic but real website!
      </p>
      <p>
        By the <span class="speed">age of 15</span>, I have learned <span class="speed">PHP</span> and developed about 5
        or 6 websites for local businesses. Some of them still exist and remain unchanged (what???), like this one for
        <span class="speed">one of the biggest coffin manufacturers</span> in Europe -
        <a class="speed" href="http://www.zpdlindner.pl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZPD Lindner</a>. I had tons of
        fun <del>stealing people's code</del> programming and gathering more and more knowledge every day. I knew
        <span class="speed">this is what I want to do</span> as an adult so I applied to
        <span class="speed">one of the best technical schools in Poland</span> that offered IT courses.
      </p>

      <img src="~assets/images/book.png" width="120" role="presentation" alt="" />
      <p>
        To be very honest, <span class="speed">I didn't learn much</span> there. Although it WAS a good school, IT
        knowledge I got from it was mostly general or <span class="speed">not relevant to web technologies</span>. The
        second half of the third year introduced a class called "Web applications" which I
        <span class="speed">totally smashed because of my previous knowledge and experience</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After four years it was time to chose my <span class="speed">University</span>. I moved to a bigger city and
        started my three-years long IT course with the hopes of getting
        <span class="speed">actual web-app knowledge</span>. In the mean-time, I found my
        <span class="speed">first official job</span> as a junior <span class="speed">Drupal</span> developer which was
        super exciting for me and really spread my wings as a developer. About 4 months into the course I learned that -
        <span class="speed">nope</span>, the course has nothing to do with web-apps and I decided to
        <span class="speed">drop-out</span> and continue gaining experience at my job.
      </p>

      <img src="~assets/images/paperplane.png" width="120" role="presentation" alt="" />
      <p>
        The idea of moving countries came out of nowhere really. I had a good, steady job, I had my friends, I was happy
        but my <span class="speed">natural curiosity</span> was telling me to
        <span class="speed">go and discover</span>. I figured why not try something (or someplace) new? If anything goes
        wrong or I don't like it, <span class="speed">I can always come back</span>. I knew nothing about Scotland or
        <span class="speed">Edinburgh</span> before moving here but when I finally arrived, holding bags containing all
        of my life belongings, I saw the city for the first time, <span class="speed">fell in love</span> and decided to
        stay.

        <strong>Starbit - Nov 2013 - Mar 2018</strong>
        <p><span class="speed">Lead developer</span></p>
        <p>
          My first job after moving to Edinburgh. Thanks to the small size of the agency I was involved in a great
          number of very <span class="speed">creative and innovative</span> projects. My role in the company has changed
          throughout the years, starting as a contractor, being a junior developer and ending with the role of a lead
          developer. I developed web applications using Drupal 7 and Wordpress but also managed a small team of
          developers. This role involved maintaining constant communication with the client via email and phone.

          Full-stack remote role. This involved mainly

      <h3 class="h3">Outro.</h3>

      <p>
        <span class="speed">Thank you</span> for visiting my page. I would like to shortly talk about the tools I used
        to create <span class="speed">this website</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve this <del>monstrosity</del> beautiful looking site I have used
        <span class="speed">Nuxt.js</span> framework, which I love using for most of my side projects. Nuxt.js is sort
        of a Vue.js on steroids. It contains pretty much everything you need to create a Vue.js website including
        routing, a store that you can use to easily send and receive data beteen components, development server and also
        server-side rendering which is great for SEO!
      </p>
      <p>
        For styling I'm using <span class="speed">SASS</span>, and <span class="speed">BEM</span> naming convention for
        my class names. In terms of back-end, well this is all handled by <span class="speed">Netlify</span> and
        deployed using <span class="speed">Github</span> - no server required (yay).
      </p>
      <p>
        The very nice dynamic marble effect background uses some SVG <span class="speed">magic</span> and a blur effect,
        but to be honest with you, I have no idea how it actually works.
      </p>
      <p>That's all, <span class="speed">BYE!</span></p>
